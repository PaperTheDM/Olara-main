            <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
            <p>
                Before borders, before nations, before civilization itself; We dreamt of flight. For no other reason than from envy of the birds which flew just out of reach. Those foolish, free birds.
                <br><br>
                One of the first professions civilization spawned was to fight and return home to collect your pay. Since the beginning, bounty work has only continued to grow and change, from a bold group 
                of those who would do just about anything for coin, to the organized and secretive groups that stalk the underworld to this very day. 
                <br><br> 
                No one quite knows how long the Crow Syndicate has been fully operational, but they have only continued to grow in power and influence; Spreading across the conquered world and gaining whispered 
                renown.
                <br><br>
                Whispers of their successes and professionalism often reach those in power who would like less than legal actions to be taken in their favor, leading to many layers of secrecy between the buyer and the bounty, 
                but with very high value work coming in.
            </p>

        <div class="bg col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12">
            <h3>Structure</h3>
            <p>Bounty work is messy and dangerous. For that reason, among others, the Syndicate organizes themselves discretely, putting together cloisters hidden within towns, cities, and kingdoms. These 
                dens are called "Aviaries" to those within the ranks. 
                <br><br>
                Each Aviary consists of atleast one <b>"Magpie"</b> or bounty distributor, and atleast two <b>"Rooks"</b> who protect their identity while providing the 
                payout for work. A magpie may travel to neighboring aviaries if their own cannot afford to complete a bounty, creating a web of work across large regions. Contrastly, Rook are expected to stay 
                near the aviary for both their own protection and to guard Syndicate secrets.
                <br><br>
                The primary force of each aviary are the agents, Crows, who take work. Membership to the Syndicate is shown by wearing a feather charm somewhere on their person, while expertise is shown by 
                the color and material of the feather. The least experienced hold a <b>white</b> feather, the swashbuckling type may hold a <b>blue</b> feather, overland experts (trackers, hunters, etc) hold <b>green</b> feathers, 
                assassins hold <b>crimson</b> feathers, thief archetypes hold <b>brown</b> feathers, and those who are considered capable of any type of work hold a <b>Gold</b> feather which give them some measure of authority over 
                other Crows.
