            <h3>Might makes Right</h3>
            <p>Goliaths, Orcs, and even Dragons tend to bow to the strongest among them. Such a primal hierarchy should be unseen in the civilized world, but the Kindom of Long defies that expectation. 
                <br><br>
                Power here is earned by those who commit great feats, generally for the good of the people. Residing in the capital city itself, a Primarch sits above all others. This primarch is someone 
                who climbed the ladder of power moving from the weakest in society to the most powerful, both physical and political. 
                <br><br>
                Primarch succession is taken care of by the regional Lordship holders. The pool of candidates is generally restricted to the Lords and Ladies of the regional provinces, considering who has done the best work for their nation. In the most dire 
                of circumstances, simple gladiatorial games have been held in order to replace the Primarch within a day of being displaced.
                <br><br>
                This idea of strength and capability making a leader, trickles down far from the top political positions. Students, Farmers, and many other fields align themselves to the same structure. 
                Second to strength, efficiency is a primary motivator across the society as a whole leading to those who are the strongest being in a direct leadership position instead of administrative. For this 
                system to work, the most powerful student remains a student, but is considered responsible for the success of other classmates. 
                <br><br>
                Similarly, the best of any field is given prestige. This system generally restricts the movement between social classes, 
                but when one achieves proficiency or displays great talent, they are encouraged to prove their mettle 
                in the respective arena of their skills. Those who succeed in the "big pond" are accepted regardless of their upbringing.

            <h3>Death before Dishonor</h3>
            <p>Top to bottom, back to front; The Kingdom of Long is deeply intertwined with an old belief in an individual's honor and familial reputations. Those who meet the average citizens of Long generally 
                find them to be pleasant by nature but capable of retaliation when disrespected. <br>
                In combination, these traits lend to a high-trust society, full of ambitious and kind folks. 
                <br><br> 
                Sharply contrasted by the kind people, the state is very militaristic at it's core which, considering the culture, operates at such a level to earn widespread renown. The stories of soldiers 
                bringing down great beasts singlehandedly, is spread both in truth and as propaganda to further ingraine the military into political matters; Impossible for outsiders to discern the difference. 
                Children dream of heroism and bards tell stories of great victories.
