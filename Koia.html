            <h3>Peace</h3>
            <p>A democracy by technicality, the people of Koia are united only by one shared belief; Peace can be achieved. While every tribe, monastery, or village may disagree on the exact method, the 
                sentiment is enough to form a coherent democratic republic. A counsel formed of every recognized leader works together to make slow but deliberate decisions on behalf of their individual 
                constituencies. The diversity of thought here is wide, but many theorize the slow nature of the counsel could be intentional, possibly as a method to hoard taxpayer funds. The Congregation 
                member for Koia is selected from among the current counsel members by vote.
                <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">The tribes</span> generally consist of small druid enclaves or nomadic groups. Despite the small size, many of these groups band together to gain a formal seat on the counsel. 
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">The monasteries</span> here are full of many practicing religious types, either devoted to the arts or to their chosen god. Boasting an impressive estimate for the count of monks, clerics, or paladins; 
                Koia rarely needs to rely on their standing military for protection, hence their central location in the city of Kalc. 
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Village</span> life in Koia differs only so slightly than other nations. The primary note is the expectation to participate in the democratic process and keep up on the taxes collected to keep the 
                state running. A majority of the population lives in villages dotted across the countryside.

            <h3>To sea or not to sea</h3>
            <p>Planted firmly along the river Ko, the capital city of Kalc stands as a monument to the power of democracy! Populated by a majority of the standing national military and their families, 
                this city acts as both a political hub but also a hub for the rather small army and moderate navy of Koia. 
                <br><br>
                Travelers come from the ports dotting the rivers here for many reasons, from tourism to sailing training to monastic pilgrims. A majority of the trade here comes through the coastal ports, 
                as few international roads are maintained by the state.
