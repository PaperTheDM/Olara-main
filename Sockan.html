            <h3>The Sovereign and Kin</h3>
            <p>
              Among the many houses of the land, one stands well above the rest. The Griisk'a'Sockan family has held ultimate 
              power for hundreds of years, ever since a precious resource was discovered below the family's small estate. 
              <br><br> 
              Having grasped power of almost the entire region, the patriarch of the family, Ahamkell Griisk'a'Sockan, divided the territory among his 6 children 
              who became the Ruk'li'har, or the Sovereign Scion(s), of The Principality. These Scions each hold power over specific provinces within the country, lead by their father. the Sovereign. 
              <br><br> 
              For unknown reasons, The Griisk'a'Sockan family has a strong affinity for fire magic, even further driving the power divide between the family and the commonfolk. This affinity
              varies in potency among the expansive family, but the most powerful members are able to take on dragons almost singlehandedly. This power was proven when, for debated reasons, dragons 
              flooded across the southern border of the region, and quickly overpowered the standing militaries. This incursion was only held at bay from the sheer power of the Ruk'li'har, securing their position 
              as the commanding force in the region.

            <h3>Trade</h3>
            <p>
              While obviously lacking in most traditional resources, the Principality of Sockan has some unique factors in its favor. Having a long coastline, much of which is uninhabitable, allows 
              Sockan almost total control of intercontinental trade to and from Eobara, the neighboring continent. 
              <br><br>
              In terms of exports, Sockan relies on a trade of (mostly involuntary) laborers. These laborers are sent from both formal Eobaran trade and regional entrepeneurs. Material goods, such as 
              produce, clothing, rare metals, precious gems, and unique cultural pieces; Often find their way through the Sockan ports.
