            <h3>Destinations Galore!</h3>
            <p>From advanced cities to darling coastlines, Bienbaiku is well known for the immense amount of things to do. Overwhelming at first, many newcomers soon find somewhere they fit in. 
                <br><br>The nervecenter of the region rests along the east coast, nestled deep in the core of the capital, Ba. Ba was named after a great mage who conquered the land single handedly, fitting 
                for the oppressive, albeit nigh ancient, architecture in the city center. This cluster of buildings contain an innumerable amount of magic items, lost knowledge, forbidden scrolls, and a menagerie of the most
                 dangerous creatures one can find. While the public can't normally visit these places, the rumors of what sits behind closed doors draws many conspiratorial types to the city. <br><br> 
                Far from the hustle and bustle of the city, the pristine coastlines beckon travelers to explore. Kept and cared for by a powerful grove of druids called the "Free Faer Concord", the 
                coasts are in the best condition one will find. Full of wonderful creatures, many of which subside here purely due to the effect the druids have. Many strange fey or elementals may wander here, 
                finding comfort basking in the magics scattered throughout.

            <h3>Magic, down to a Science</h3>
            <p>Isolated from wars, plagues, and a multitude of cataclysms; Bienbaiku has all the pleasant benefits of being able to develop and grow with less setbacks than many other societies. <br><br> 
                Generations of talented mages, archdruids, and artificers have pushed the boundaries of what is considered possible for mortals by way of the weave. Strong focuses on the arcane arts have 
                given way to many advancements and allowed for a wholely unique way of life for the people of Bienbaiku. The most well known inventions from the region stem from sentient constructs to arcane trolley 
                systems to weapons of mass destruction. 
                <br><br>
                Despite being such an advanced society, cultural developement is almost stagnant; Leading way to old customs being well cemented, even into law. The most shockingly outdated of these customs would be 
                the caste system focused on magical prowess. While outsiders who come as tourists or visitors may not be exposed to the dark underbelly, citizens of Bienbaiku struggle constantly to advance their power. Being
                unable to cast spells or perform magical effects would functionally earn one a status less than or equal to cattle, while one who can keep up into their adult life can normally sustain a middling status. 
                The truly exceptional, though, earn themselves a place of authority. Some of these mages pursue governmental roles, but the bulk of these select few become educators or continue their work supported by 
                state sponsorships.

            <h3>Supremacy Caste</h3>
            <p>All across the country, magic is considered the most important factor in one's life. One's arcane ability determines their social, fiscal, and even political positions. The great emphasis 
                even works its way into the military, leading to some incredibly diverse tactics and operations this force is capable of. 
                <br><br>
                Feared by those with the awareness of their existence, the special 
                operations units name themselves after mystical beasts and can travel great distances to accomplish their tasks. Specially selected task forces are given important tasks all across the 
                world, making conscious effort to not step on the toes of another nation so as to be able to claim neutrality if tensions rise.

                <h3>Mystra Monopolized</h3>
                <p>The church of BienBaiku is influenced by the caste system as well. The clergy are held in high regard, only to be given authority when they have proven themselves to Mystra to be worthy 
                    of the position. Mystra often takes greatly talented mages under her protection, eventually granting them the title of "chosen of Mystra". These chosen, purely by statistics, are very 
                    often found in Bienbaiku which, once discovered, are given special positions within the church.
