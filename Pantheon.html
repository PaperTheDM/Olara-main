            <h3>Cosmic Egos</h3>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">In</span> the days of old, the deity charged with the control of deities; Placed a strict law, preventing gods from visiting the material plane. As such, archdevils, archfey, demon lords, and demigods
                moved about, free of worry to defend their territory. 
                <br><br> 
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">As</span> this environment came to harm against mortals, Ao, the overgod, chose to grant a degree of mortality to any higher being who walked this world, 
                including even the mightiest of deities who chose to risk 
                their divinity. The prospect of portfolios being up for grabs encouraged the most daring gods to send an avatar, if not travel here themselves, to stake a claim anywhere they can manage. 
                This messy collection of the strongest egos in the multiverse caused what we all "Divine Convergence", which is the risk of an overgod forming. This threat spawning from the mutability of the 
                divine. 
                <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Despite</span> many travelling gods finding themselves in Olara, if at least by influence, an ever-evolving pantheon still claims the realm as their own. These gods 
                still fall under the jurisdiction of Ao, but find themselves in a soft hierarchy contained to the gods choosing to stay in Olara. Loosing ranked by religious scholars, the gods fall 
                into five distinct categories. 
                <br><br>

                        Often contained within their own realms, the influence they have is usually kept within a well-defined group, demographic, or region. These gods include local patron deities, 
                        racial patrons, or those with strange portfolios. <br><br>Some examples of these lesser gods are Lolth, Maglubyet, or Malar.

                        The lowest of those who can hold unique divine power, Quasi-Deities have few, if any, followers and rarely have dedicated site of worship. These deities are sometimes overlapped by demigods 
                        with the difference generally being the functional immortality held by Quasi-Deities. Powerful Archfey, Demon Lords, ArchDevils, and Ascendant True Dragons are considered Quasi-Deities, if

                        Demigods come and go as generations move on. Well within the realm of someone who could be defeated by powerful adventurers at the top of their game, Demigods do not last long unless backed by 
                        higher powers or rock-solid assistance. <br><br>One can find Demigods among Legendary heroes, Greatwyrms, and Scions of the Giants.
