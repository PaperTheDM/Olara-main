            Aboleth subtly pull strings in both this plane and the prime material, as they seek to rally the planes against mount celestia. Controlling many

            Triton and Merfolk communities hold true as bastions of freedom compared to the slavery and control of the Marid and Aboleth.These societies 
            are generally welcoming to any civilized people who pass through.
